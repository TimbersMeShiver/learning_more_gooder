How are the constants (400, 10, 32) in the Elo rating system chosen? | The constants are empirically determined and fine-tuned based on historical data and practical considerations.
Why is the constant 400 used in the Elo rating system? | The constant 400 ensures that a 400-point rating difference corresponds roughly to a 10:1 expected outcome ratio between players.
What is the purpose of the base number 10 in the Elo rating system? | The base number 10 scales the rating difference between players and provides a balanced expected outcome range between 0 and 1.
Why is the constant 32 used in the Elo rating system for rating adjustments? | The constant 32 determines the magnitude of rating adjustments and represents the typical amount of Elo rating change for an individual match.
What is the scope of market microstructure? | The scope of market microstructure covers the study of trading mechanisms, order placement techniques, price formation dynamics, and market liquidity in financial markets.

Draw-down Hitting Zero | Investor starts with $1000 portfolio. After a series of losses (20%, 50%, 100%), portfolio value decreases to $0. When draw-down hits zero, no capital left for further investments. In predictive systems with compensation, no balance left for payouts; need for additional resources or cessation of operation.

What is bid-offer spread? | Difference between buyers' purchase price (bid) and sellers' sale price (ask or offer) in an asset.
How does bid-offer spread relate to market liquidity? | Narrow bid-offer spread indicates higher liquidity, while wider spread suggests lower liquidity.
How does bid-offer spread impact transaction costs? | Wider bid-offer spreads generally increase transaction costs, as buyers pay more and sellers receive less.
What is a totalizator? | System in gambling, notably horse racing, where bets of a type are pooled; after house takeout, remaining money is distributed among winners.
What is another term for totalizator? | Pari-mutuel betting.
How are payout odds determined in totalizator betting? | Payout odds fluctuate based on betting patterns; calculated by dividing the total pool by the amount wagered on winning outcome.
What is active market making? | The practice of providing liquidity to financial markets by continuously offering to buy (bid) and sell (offer) securities.
What role do market makers play in financial markets? | They ensure there's always a buyer and seller for investors, thereby contributing to overall liquidity and efficiency of markets.
How do market makers profit? | They aim to profit from the bid-offer spread.
What strategies might traders employ around bid-offer spreads? | High frequency traders might exploit minute bid-offer spread differences for arbitrage opportunities.
What implications does totalizator betting have for gamblers? | Since odds fluctuate, strategic timing of bets may impact potential payouts.
Combinatorial Parimutuel Markets (CPMs) | Concept derived from parimutuel betting principles applied to financial derivatives by Robert Baron and Eva Lange, involving bundling of underlying states and combinatorial clearing.
Bundling of Underlying States in CPMs | Equivalent to betting types in parimutuel system, but applied to financial instruments. Example: betting on a bundle of stocks to rise, or a specific bond yield to fall within a certain range.
Combinatorial Clearing in CPMs | Mechanism determining prices and quantities of each bundle at the close of betting, based on total bet amount on each bundle.
Financial Applications of CPMs | Primarily in pricing complex derivatives and exotic options, suitable for situations with high uncertainty or a wide range of possible outcomes.
Pros and Cons of CPMs | Pros: Pricing variety of financial products, incorporating market sentiment in real-time. Cons: Requires sufficient liquidity and participation, complexity may deter some market participants.
Parimutuel vs. Fixed-Odds Markets | Parimutuel markets allow for flexible odds responding to crowd's perception of probabilities, with bettors bearing the risk. Contrast to fixed-odds markets where bookmakers set odds and bear risk of incorrect pricing.
Fluctuating Odds in Parimutuel Betting | Unlike fixed-odds betting, parimutuel betting odds fluctuate in real-time based on the distribution of money bet on each possible outcome. Final odds aren't determined until betting closes.
Meaning of "Parimutuel" | French for "mutual betting", parimutuel refers to bettors essentially betting against each other rather than the house, as the payoff depends on the total amount bet and the number of winners.
Bet Types in Parimutuel Betting | Parimutuel betting often includes bets beyond predicting the outright winner, such as 'place', 'show', or 'exacta' bets. Each bet type typically has a separate betting pool.
House Takeout in Parimutuel Betting | House takeout is the portion of the betting pool kept by the house (like a racetrack or betting agency) to cover costs and profit. Its size can significantly impact potential payouts.
Bettor Strategy in Parimutuel Betting | Bettors consider the outcome likelihood and how they believe the public will wager. This is called 'playing the tote board', trying to identify over or under bet outcomes based on displayed odds.
Tote Board | An electronic board displaying the odds for each potential outcome in a parimutuel betting event, updating in real-time as bets are placed and pools change. It often displays the total amount bet on each outcome.
Dividend Calculation and Breakage in Parimutuel Betting | Winnings are calculated by dividing the total pool (after house takeout) by the total amount bet on the winning outcome(s), rounded down to a set denomination, with the remainder (breakage) going to the house.
Mathematical Calculation of Parimutuel Odds | Parimutuel odds are calculated by dividing the total amount bet on all outcomes by the total bet on a specific outcome, then subtracting one. The process repeats as new bets are made.
Impact of House Takeout on Parimutuel Payouts | House takeout reduces the total payout pool in parimutuel betting. A higher takeout reduces potential winnings for bettors but increases revenue for the house.
Concept of Overlays and Underlays in Parimutuel Betting | Overlays are outcomes perceived as having higher actual odds than the tote board suggests, while underlays have lower. Bettors aim to identify overlays for potential value.
Breakage in Parimutuel Payouts | Breakage is the rounding down of parimutuel payouts to the nearest pre-set denomination, with the remainder kept by the house. This can subtly increase house advantage.
History of Parimutuel Betting | Parimutuel betting was first introduced in France in the late 19th century by Pierre Oller. It became popular worldwide, especially for horse racing, and is also used in jai alai, greyhound racing, and some lotteries.
